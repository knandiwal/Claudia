You need to have local server to see the content of this app.
I use brackets to create locahost.

app starts with app-index.html, not index.html


widgets are loaded on the right and they are draggable.
the container which acts as container, is droppable and accepts widgets on the left.

on the bottom there is a button called 'select repositories'. which uses jsonp to fetch my(Varand) 
public repositories.

once fetched you can choose which project to get the updates.

Update with latest is the button that should update git repository with the latest code created by the user.

Update phonegap zip is the button that should create local zip file and updates phonegap build. 
(I belive this is not possible in JS only , we need server side language such as Java)

Download APK button is downloading the ready apk from phonegap build.
