Claudia
=======

This project solely demonstrates my knowledge and abilities in modern technologies and it doesn't have any commercial use:

Claudia is an application written in javascript, taking advantages of 
AngularJS,
jQuery,
Phonegap Framework,
HTML5 and
bootstrap.

You need to have local server to see the content of this app.
I use brackets to create locahost.

application starts by launching app-index.html, not index.html.

widgets are loaded on the left side and they are draggable.
the container which acts as mobile, is droppable and accepts widgets.

on the bottom there is a button called 'select repositories'. which uses jsonp to fetch my(Varand) 
public repositories.

once fetched you can choose which project to update.

"Update with latest" is the button that should update git repository with the latest code created by the user.

Download APK button is downloading the ready apk from phonegap build.
